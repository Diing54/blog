[{"content":"Today I learnt something worth publishing here. As developers we write code day by day and it is executed by our machines. But how does our computers understand this code and execute it ?\nI am going to walk through the four core changes of a GCC compiler to transform a simple C program into a state that a machine can understand and execute.\nI created a simple file main.c below:\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { int a = 10; int b = 5; int result = a + b; printf(\u0026#34;The result is: %d\\n\u0026#34;, result); return 0; } Step 1: Invoking the Preprocessor This is the first stage. The preprocessor finds this line, #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;, in order to extract the stdio.h header file and paste its entire contents into our source code main.c\nWe run the command gcc -E main.c -o main.i The -E flag tells the GCC to stop after preprocessing -o main.i specifies the output file name. The .i extension is the standard for preprocessed C files Step 2: Compile to Assembly Code We take the preprocessed file and compile it to assembly language, a low-level, but still human-readable.\nWe run the command gcc -S main.i -o main.s The -S flag tells the compiler/GCC to stop after compiling to assembly The output is main.s with assembly code inside Step 3: Assemble to Object Code The assembler\u0026rsquo;s job is to convert the human-readable assembly code into pure machine code (binary)\nWe run the command gcc -c main.s -o main.o The -c flag tells the compiler to stop after the assembly stage The output is the object file main.o which is not yet executable Step 4: Link to Create an Executable File Our object file main.o contains the machine code for our main function but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain the code for the printf function. The linker\u0026rsquo;s job is to find the printf code in the C standard library and combine it with our object file to create a runnable program\nWe run the command gcc main.o -o my_program The final executable file my_program is created In the terminal, we can now run our program\n./my_program\nThe output is:\nThe result is: 15\nReferences ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/posts/under-the-hood-of-a-gcc-compiler/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday I learnt something worth publishing here.
