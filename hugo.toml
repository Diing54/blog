    Welcome to my digital garden where I document my path learning DevOps 
    technologies and system administration. This space serves as both my 
    learning journal and a resource for others interested in infrastructure,
    automation, and cloud technologies.

    I'm currently focused on mastering Linux fundamentals, containerization
    with Docker, infrastructure as code, and building reliable CI/CD pipelines.
    Each post represents a concept I've explored deeply, often with practical
    examples and code snippets that you can use in your own projects.
