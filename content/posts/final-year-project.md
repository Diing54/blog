I have been working on my final year project lately. Today, I plan to export  the trained model onto the raspberry pi AI camera hardware. The model size is 22 mbs and the AI camera can accommodate only 8 mbs. Luckily, there are quantization methods provided by ultralytics that will shrink the model without it losing too much accuracy.
