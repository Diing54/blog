Another day creating another automation, it may not be a complex one but still its an automation. Today I created another simple beautiful script that automates my blogging workflow. Instead of manually navigating to my Hugo directory and running commands, I can create a new post from anywhere in my system by just running the custom command "blog".
**How it works**
- Run `blog` from the command line
- Enter your blog title
- The scripts automatically generates a file using Hugo's archetype template. The file's name is the title provided
- It then opens the file automatically in Neovim for editing
