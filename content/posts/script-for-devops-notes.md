I created a simple script for generating a new note for my devops learning notes. This will increase my productivity since I will not have to bother typing current dates and times of each and every note. The script works perfect as I only type "devops" on my command line in any directory and I'm prompted to enter the name of the file which will also be the title of the note.

All this is done by bash scripting and an existing template which will be used in generating all the notes.
