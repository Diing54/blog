Finally, I have decided to render my DevOps notes on a site powered by Hugo and Hextra and deployed it using github pages. This is what I call My Kasten, a German word meaning a crate or a container. It will act as my Second Brain where I will document everything I will be learning.

The purpose of this is that I believe it will help me in the future or anyone else who will find it useful to refer to something.
